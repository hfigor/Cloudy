    //    Because the week view view model is now responsible for supplying a view model for each table view cell of the week view controller,
    //    we need to implement a new method, viewModel(for:). This method takes an index as its only argument.
    //    The index corresponds with a row in the table view of the week view controller. The viewModel(for:) method returns an instance of the WeatherDayViewViewModel struct.
    
    //   We will use a protocol to pass this to the table view cell
    func viewModel(for index: Int) -> WeatherDayViewViewModel {
        return WeatherDayViewViewModel(weatherDayData: weatherData[index])
    }
